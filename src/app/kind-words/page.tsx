                    really took the time to get to know us. On the day itself,
                    she was incredible. The way she captured our day was

                    wedding photos. They are beautiful beyond words and I will
                    treasure them forever. Chloe is not just a photographer but
                    an artist who captures love in its purest form. Thank you so
                    much for everything, Chloe. You are absolutely amazing!

                    special days (the intimate legal & the big performance
                    affair) were out of this world. You&apos;ve captured

                    Getting the chance to relive our days through your
                    incredible eye is such a blessing. I, Hannah, could not of
                    gotten through both days without you! Not just a

                    a sugar rush help, a bridesmaids basically haha & most

                    search with Chloe, she&apos;s no short of a genius! Every

                    to capture our wedding. Having a very small wedding meant we
                    needed a photographer that fit in, but you also completely
                    made the day and everyone loved you. From getting ready with
                    my sister to capturing the after ceremony drinks with
                    family, we loved sharing it all with you. From the first
                    phone call you were amazing, and kept us nicely informed
                    about what would happen on the day. You really understood
                    what we wanted, and executed it so well on the day, taking
                    into account other family members. You spookily timed it so
                    well giving us the preview pics while we were coming back
                    from Ibiza, and then the full gallery in the middle of our
                    honeymoon in Costa Rica. It was all so perfect. The pictures
                    are STUNNING. The ones that make me the most emotional are
                    the candid moments I didn&apos;t see happening, you captured
                    the love and happiness on the day so well and immortalised
                    it into gorgeous stylish pics. Is 6 months too soon to renew
                    our vows just to have you there again? Trust me when I say I
                    shopped around for months, so I have a lot to compare to in
                    price and quality. Makes me a bit sad thinking we could have
                    booked with someone else, our keepsakes from the day just
                    weren&apos;t have been the same.&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;From start to finish Chloe was the perfect
                    photographer for our wedding. We wanted to make sure we
                    would have photos that would help us re-live the day and
                    Chloe did exactly that! She has such a unique style and was
                    able to capture so many incredible moments that we
                    didn&apos;t see on the day, we are so genuinely grateful to
                    have these memories forever. Apart from the photos, she
                    brought such great energy and an ease to the day that we
                    could never thank her enough for! She made the whole process
                    so easy and effortless and was flexible in meeting our needs
                    on the day. If you are looking for a wedding photographer to
                    capture the genuine and authentic feeling in every moment of
                    your wedding - Chloe is the one! Thank you Chloe!&rdquo;

                  &ldquo;Chloe absolutely exceeded our expectations and if
                  you&apos;ve seen her instagram, you know they were high to
                  start with. Not only are her photos obscenely good, she&apos;s
                  so fun and friendly, you immediately feel at ease and then you
                  hardly see her for the rest of the wedding because she&apos;s
                  an expert in capturing moments without encroaching. The
                  gallery captured our wedding beautifully and we&apos;ll
                  treasure the photos forever. Could not recommend her
                  enough.&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;Now it&apos;s all over, we just can&apos;t imagine
                    having had anyone else photograph our day. I came across
                    Chloe&apos;s work online whilst looking for a photographer
                    and I knew from the minute I saw her portfolio and Instagram
                    that she needed to photograph our wedding. There&apos;s
                    something about the way in which she captures you that sets
                    her apart from anyone else you&apos;ll come across and
                    it&apos;s not something you can put your finger on! I am in
                    love with her black and white work and honestly can&apos;t
                    imagine putting anything else up on my wall. Chatting to her
                    in the lead up about what we wanted put us so at ease and it
                    was like chatting to your friend! Not being super sure of
                    what you want is actually a bonus I think, because we very
                    much took the day how it came and Chloe was our guiding
                    light for 2 hours helping us get some shots to remember our
                    wedding. Now it&apos;s all over we just can&apos;t imagine
                    having had anyone else photograph our day, Chloe brought so
                    much calm and patience to the table. She was so fun to be
                    around too and it was the most relaxing way to be
                    photographed I think I&apos;ve ever experienced! Literally
                    forget ever posing for photographs again because she will
                    just capture the most raw and beautiful moments without you
                    having to try for anything, and believe me we can be very
                    awkward people for photographs! I&apos;m just not over it
                    one bitâ€¦ One of the best days of my life with the best
                    photographer we could have had - everyone has literally said
                    how beautiful the photos are already! So much love
                    Chloe.&rdquo;
