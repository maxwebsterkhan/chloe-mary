            your wedding day and just want to take this opportunity to say a
            massive thank you. It has been my privilege to be trusted by so many

                To benefit from a documentary approach and to best preserve your
                experience of the day, it&apos;s best to keep formal group
                photos to a minimum. Feel free to skip this part if you&apos;re
                deciding not to include them.
              </p>
              <div className={styles.highlight}>
                <p>
                  Having witnessed this portion of the day countless times, I
                  can tell you first-hand that it can quickly become stressful,
                  and people don&apos;t want to spend too long on these photos.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Therefore, only include group photos if you genuinely want them
                and inform your friends and family in advance. Allocate enough
                time for group photos (each photo can take 3-5 minutes), and
                please ensure your designated &apos;helpful person&apos; knows
                the people listed. It is their responsibility to gather the
                people for each photo and ensure no groups are missed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Include no more than 8 groups and try to limit participants to
                immediate family only, with ideally no more than 15 people per
                photo. Something to bear in mind is family members will always
                try to add in an extra cheeky one or two groups and this is
                another reason I advise to keep your actual list short - that
                way, if they do add more on the day, we still have time for the
                ones you actually want.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless it&apos;s something you really want, I do recommend to
                avoid the &apos;everyone&apos; photo. It can be difficult to
                gather everyone in a timely manner and also ensure they are all
                visible in the final photo.

                it becoming too extensive and taking away from your day.

            <div className={styles.content}>
              <p>
                I do advise that to get the best confetti, you should directly
                supply the confetti to your guests yourselves. Gone are the days
                when guests bring their own confetti to weddings due to venue
                restrictions or uncertainty on if you&apos;re partaking in this
                moment.
              </p>
              <div className={styles.highlight}>
                <p>
                  A lot of weddings now opt to skip confetti (especially central
                  London ones) so if you&apos;re one of those couples, feel free
                  to skip this section.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>If you&apos;re partaking, here&apos;s some top tips:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Check your venue are happy for you to have confetti and if
                  there are any restrictions they might have in place - certain
                  restrictions can apply at churches or anywhere with animals on
                  site and some are restrictive on colours due to colour
                  transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The more confetti, the merrier. Aim for around two handfuls
                  per guest and around two canons if you want the full
                  experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Larger biodegradable paper circles show up really well in
                  photos and &apos;Your Confetti&apos; are great suppliers of
                  this type of confetti. They have the option to mix and match
                  colours to work with colour schemes and have kindly supplied
                  me with an exclusive discount code for you to use - Use code
                  &apos;YCBYCHLOEMARY&apos; to get 15% off your order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For natural candid confetti images, make sure you enjoy the
                  experience. As you walk, just look at each other, take in the
                  joy of the moment and just have fun with it. It will go
                  EVERYWHERE but we can deal with this after - there&apos;s
                  nothing worse than someone fussing over you mid confetti line
                  to get it out of your hair or your dress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don&apos;t worry about cones or bags for the confetti. Just
                  pop it into a big basket or vessel of sorts and get your
                  guests to grab handfuls. It&apos;s easier for them to throw
                  and easier for you when organising.

                I really do advise even the most camera shy to go for a quick
                portrait session. It&apos;s not only a great time to capture you
                both in your full glam, but it&apos;s also a good time to take
                you away from the hustle and bustle of the day.

                  The number one regret most couples have from their day is that
                  they didn&apos;t get enough time together with their partner.

                Feel free to even use this time just to be with each other and
                celebrate the fact you just got hitched - you can even bring
                along a glass of bubbles or a bottle of beer for the moment too.

                15 minutes is all I need for a few quick photos of the two of
                you. The key to natural photos is to just keep moving. If you
                want to do less than 15 minutes, this is also totally okay.
                It&apos;s more important to me that you have the best day ever
                and prioritise what&apos;s important to YOU.

                We will normally go for a little walk around your ceremony
                location (central London we can even jump in a taxi / on the
                underground) and just have a chat with each other. The main tip
                I can give is to just try and let yourself relax and push past
                any &apos;awkward&apos; feelings.

                I don&apos;t need your timelines any further than about 4 weeks
                in advance and my automated system will send you out a little
                questionnaire asking for all the information I need to allow me
                to know what&apos;s going on and when it&apos;s happening.

                  I&apos;m not looking for a minute by minute rundown of your
                  day and to best benefit from a documentary approach, I&apos;d
                  advise to not to plan things out this way either.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>Here are some helpful tips about timeline planning:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You need to include any travel time between venues within your
                  coverage hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The officiant performing your ceremony will usually want you
                  to arrive 15 mins before the ceremony starts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can do another couple portrait session in the evening if
                  you&apos;re looking for some variation in your couples photos.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you want both of your prep times covered (and are getting
                  ready at separate locations) multiple angles of your ceremony
                  and speeches or simply just want more candid photos, it&apos;s
                  best to add a second shooter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Group shots usually work best after your ceremony during
                  cocktail hour/before wedding breakfast call in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoid putting any speeches between courses - it can be quite
                  jarring as a guest and can cause logistical issues.
                </li>

                  Trust and connection are the biggest factors that impact my
                  work. I&apos;m a big believer that both go hand in hand in
                  playing a huge role in how I capture the day.

                By the time your day comes around, I want it to feel like
                you&apos;re just catching up with an old friend. Couples who
                come to me are the type of people craving something more real
                from their photos and want to see everyone&apos;s genuine love
                and joy and emotions.
              </p>
              <p>Some final pieces of advice:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If it rains - it rains. Make weather permitting plans and try
                  not to etch anything into stone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Having one or two helpful people around for group photo
                  gathering will help formals run more smoothly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If having that &apos;first kiss&apos; moment captured is
                  really important to you, try to hold it for a few seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You don&apos;t have to have a photo of you signing your
                  register if you don&apos;t want it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take all of my advice with a pinch of salt - it&apos;s
                  important you have the day YOU want to have.
